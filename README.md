# wgpu-lab

### todos
- design and implement a library of functions and abstractions for webgpu
- load shaders from file
- shader module class
- pipeline class ?
- maybe add support for more windowing library backends like SDL2 in the future

### Ideas

##### doc generator
- script that can parse all source files to compile a documentation in obsidian vault format
- includes evaluated to connect nodes in obsidian graph view
- comments parsed to describe structs and functions

##### fuzz testing
- generate randomized tests for creating, deleting and using various lab objects in random orders
  to discover undefined behaviors and interface weaknesses
